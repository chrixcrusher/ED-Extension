# Overview
Welcome to the official documentation for E/Dify, a powerful chrome extension designed to encode and decode messages. This README.md file will provide you with a comprehensive understanding of the project, its functionality, and the rationale behind the design choices.

## Project Description
E/Dify is a chrome extension that offers a seamless solution for encoding and decoding messages. It empowers users to transform their plain text into secret codes using a unique seed-multiplier system. With E/Dify, you can add an extra layer of security and excitement to your messages.

## Files and Functionality
The E/Dify project consists of several key files, each playing a crucial role in the overall functionality of the extension. Here's a breakdown of the main files and their purposes:
**script.js:** This file serves as the backbone of E/Dify, handling the core logic and functionality. It manages the encryption and decryption processes, as well as the generation of encrypting patterns based on the seed provided by the user This file also acts as the content script for E/Dify. 
**popup.html and popup.js:** These files handle the user interface of the extension's popup window. They provide users with an intuitive interface to input their messages, seed-multiplier values, and perform encryption or decryption operations.
manifest.json: This file is crucial for the proper functioning of the chrome extension. It defines the necessary permissions, scripts, and other metadata required for E/Dify to run seamlessly.
**popup.css:** responsible for defining the visual style and appearance of the popup window. It works in conjunction with the popup.html and popup.js files to create a cohesive and user-friendly interface.
**manifest.json:** This file is crucial for the proper functioning of the chrome extension. It defines the necessary permissions, scripts, and other metadata required for E/Dify to run seamlessly.
**seedrandom.min.js:** This file is a JavaScript library that provides a seeded random number generator. It allows you to generate pseudo-random numbers based on a given seed value. The library offers functions for initializing the generator, generating random numbers, and controlling the randomness.

## Design Choices and Rationale
Throughout the development of E/Dify, several design choices were carefully considered to ensure a user-friendly and efficient experience. Here are some of the key design choices and the rationale behind them:
### Seed-Multiplier System:
The decision to implement a seed-multiplier system was made to provide users with a flexible and customizable encryption method. By allowing users to provide their own seed and multiplier values, E/Dify ensures that each user can create unique encrypting patterns, enhancing the security of their messages.
### File Upload Functionality: 
E/Dify's ability to handle file uploads and perform encryption or decryption operations on text files was a deliberate choice to enhance its versatility. This feature enables users to secure entire documents and maintain the confidentiality of their contents.
### Output Text Area Enhancements: 
The inclusion of a copy button and an export button in the outputted message textarea was aimed at improving user convenience and ease of use. These buttons allow users to quickly copy their encrypted or decrypted messages with a single click or export them as a txt.file for further use.
### Light Mode for Encryption, Dark Mode for Decryption:
The E/Dify chrome extension employs a light mode for encryption and a dark mode for decryption. This design enhances the user experience by providing visual cues that align with the extension's functionality. The light mode creates a sense of security and simplicity for inputting messages, while the dark mode adds a mysterious ambiance for decoding hidden messages. This design choice follows established user expectations and improves usability by quickly conveying the current mode to users. Overall, the light mode for encryption and dark mode for decryption enhance the user experience and contribute to a seamless interaction.
